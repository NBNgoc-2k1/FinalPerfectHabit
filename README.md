# FinalPerfectHabit
Perfect Habit is an app that helps you plan and perform routines efficiently. With an user-friendly and intuitive interface, the app will give to you the greatest experience while you don't also take too many time to learn how to use app.
Because my first project used React Native, its features have limitations. Perfect Habit only can add new habits, remove, update, and read habits from database. Besides, the app can categorize habits by completion and a countdown timer for routines that need to be done in a specific time.

Habit properties: name, alarm, timer, description, habit state ( completed or not or missed )
